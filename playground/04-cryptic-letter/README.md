## Загадъчно писмо :secret:

Това мистериозно послание в код пристигна по пощата една сутрин. Разбираш ли нещо?

```java
public class LetterDecoder {

    /**
     * Ava J. sent you a letter for your secret annual meeting.
     * You must decode it to understand when the meeting will take place.
     * Ava never makes mistakes when writing her letters. If you ever see one, consider that a clue.
     * <p>
     * The first 3 letters of Ava's letters always represents the *month*. Be sure of that.
     * <p>
     * Decode the exact *hour* of the meeting by counting the number of hidden paragraphs.
     * If you see a punctuation mistake that would mean the end of a hidden paragraph. *1*
     * If you count more that 24 hours, something is not quite right.
     * <p>
     * Decode the exact *minutes* of the meeting by counting the number of misplaced symbols.
     * For every misplaced symbol add 5 minutes. *2*
     * If you count more than 60 minutes, something is not quite right.
     * <p>
     * Decode the exact *day* of the month Ava wants you to meet her by counting the length
     * of the hidden paragraph which starts with the word "The" (including a period at the end). *3,4*
     * <p>
     * *1* - Ava would never make punctuation mistakes.
     * Normally every sentence in her letters ends with one occurrence of a period, no more no less.
     * *2* - Ava would never replace letters from the alphabet with symbols.
     * Normally she writes S instead of $.
     * *3* - Ava would never start a hidden paragraph with the word "The".
     * *4* - Ava would never leave a lot of unnecessary space between the hidden paragraphs.
     * Either at the start, or the end.
     *
     * @param message The coded message that Ava sent you.
     * @return decoded Message in the format [*day* *month* at *hour*:*minutes*], e.g. "17th October at 9:00".
     * Print "Maybe another *time*" if you feel something is not right.
     * (Replace *time* with the reason you think the meeting might not happen,
     * е.g. "Maybe another day" or "Maybe another minute").
     * If the message is empty, print "Maybe another day".
     */
    public String decodeMessage(final String message) {
        // TBD: replace with your solution
        return null;
    }

}

Напомня ми за една случка от *A Series of Unfortunate Events*.
